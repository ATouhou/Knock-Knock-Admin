== Knock Knock Admin by Luciano Laporta Podazza (luciano (At) hack-it * com * ar) ==

A simple "port knocking" style security layer for website administration panels.
This software works in two steps:

1st. Set up your passphrase and directory to protect
2nd. Include the kka.php script in the very top of your index.php to activate it.
3rd. Do the knock knock and get into your restricted area :)

== Detail ==
   
If an attacker tries to find your admin directory and he does, KKA 
will throw a 404 error like if it isn't there (avoiding automated attack tools and 
manual checking).

For example:

"http://www.site.com/admin" contains your admin panel. Its normal behaviour is
to show your administration panel, allowing an attacker to perform checks like
brute-force, wordlists, SQL injection, etc.

Using KKA allows you to set up a passphrase like "chuck norris style" (no matter
 the lenght and characters distribution) and to use as follows:

1st knock: http://www.site.com/admin/?chuck
It's the 1st success but it throws a 404 error.

2nd knock: http://www.site.com/admin/?norris
2nd success but it throws a 404 error.

3rd knock: http://www.site.com/admin/?style
3rd (and last) success but it throws a 404 error.

Now you can go to  http://www.site.com/admin/ and the admin panel will appear! :)

== Notes ==
I've choosed php for this tool instead of mod_rewrite or things like that
 because of php popularity and availability against the rest of the technologies.
Also this is intended for people who host their websites in a hosting limited access environment.

This is just another security layer to use in your systems, this doesn't represent
a bullet proof system nor any guarantees of not being hacked. Remember that there's
a *lot* of attack vectors that makes this tool useless so please avoid flaming me ;)

== Known vulnerabilities ==
1. If KKA is in your /admin/ path and you have, for instance, /admin/images/ (wich throws
 any kind of response) an attacker may guess that /admin/ exists. 
It depends on the server policies but it gives an idea to the attacker that if 
/images/ exists, then /admin/ exists too. Anyhow it would be hard to guess/brute-force
the passphrase to get in. I've to work on this later.

2. If an attacker sniffs your LAN he can analyze the traffic and see that you're accesing 
to URL's like "/admin/?whatever". Showing the passphrase to him.

3. If the attacker have access to your browsing history, he can know what the passphrase is too.

4. If you choose to use Sessions or Cookies in KKA instead of a txt file, the script will return the id to the user even if there's a 404 error. This issue reveals that something's happening "behind scenes" so it won't be stealth.

== TODO ==
1. Currently KKA allows access from one IP address. I will work to deattach the session for multiples IP.
2. Deny access to sub-directories.
3. Close the actual session. Currently the only way to close the session is that your IP or passphrase changes (this regenerates the txt file)
